# SimpliPay

SimpliPay is a prototype payment system website developed as a college software engineering project. This application simulates a UPI-like payment experience where users can register, create *fake* UPI IDs, deposit money, send money to other users, and view transaction history. This is a **simulation only** and does not involve real transactions.
